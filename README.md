# x.x

A Clojure [Entity Component System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) working on plain atoms, maps and keywords.

> Entity component system (ECS) is a software architectural pattern mostly used in video game development for the representation of game world objects. An ECS comprises entities composed from components of data, with systems which operate on entities' components.
>
> ECS follows the principle of composition over inheritance, meaning that every entity is defined not by a type hierarchy, but by the components that are associated with it. Systems act globally over all entities which have the required components.

# Rationale

Because game state is stored in different atoms for each entity, we have to make use with side effects.
But for functions which only handle local component/entity state we want to make them purely functional.
x.x allows us to separate both functions with side effects and pure functions cleanly.

# Future work

* Transients in the reduce fns

* Datomic? (not walk all entity keys all the time but query directly for components)

## Glossary

Abbreviation | Meaning | Datatype
----- | ----    | ----
 c   | (component) type  | keyword
 v   | (component) value | anything
 e   | entity            | map
 r   | entity-reference  | atom
 sys | system            | multimethod

Note that the main system works just with plain maps
and using atoms and systems with side-effects do not need to be used.

## Example

``` clojure
(require '[x.x :as x])

(x/defsystem create   [c v] v) ; just takes value and returns new value
(x/defsystem create-e [c e] e) ; just takes entity and returns new entity
(x/defsystem create!  [c r]) ; for side-effects

(x/extend-component :a
  (create [_ v] (inc v))
  (create-e [_ e] (update e :foo dec))
  (create! [_ r]
    (println "CREATE A !")
    (swap! r assoc-in [:fooz :bar :baz] 3)))

(x/extend-component :b
  (create-e [_ e] (assoc e :babaz :cool))
  (create! [_ r] (println "B says hi")))

(def create-systems [create create-e create!])

(x/!x! create-systems (atom {:a 0 :b 10 :foo 10}))
; =>
; CREATE A !
; B says hi
; {:a 1, :b 10, :foo 9, :babaz :cool, :fooz {:bar {:baz 3}}}

; using extra params with defsystem

(x/defsystem tick [component value delta] value)

(x/extend-component :a
  (tick [_ v delta]
    (update v :counter + delta)))

(x/reduce-v tick {:a {:counter 0}} 10)
; {:a {:counter 10}}
```
